First entry of the update log!

I've actually been working on the project for about a week now.
I've managed to get the website up and running, accessible from over the internet.
The security cert still gives me warning with some AltName or something.
I'll solve that by tomorrow.

All the dependencies and stuff has already been decided.
We're using node with socket.io. I decided on this after looking at C# code for the
server, and NOT UNDERSTANDING A SINGLE THING. I could slowly learn it, but frankly
ain't nobody got time for that shit. Javascript's nice in it's own way anyway.
For the client side, we're using Pixi.js for the graphics. Right now it seems like
I have to make all the art/graphics by myself, since my other group members won't do art.
I'll do pixel art so it doesn't overwhelm me. Last thing I want is to deal with 3D models.
For sound I'll use howler.js. The sound is lower priority, but I hope I'll have enough tim eto do that.

As for progress I'm now only laying all the groundwork for the whole project,
including the API that I (and Qing Ning) will be using. Frankly that's the most difficult part,
but that means once I manage to finish that, that layer of abstraction will make things much
easier in the long run.

Nigel's handling all database nonsense, do I got that going for me.
Bryan's already done the login thing, it's a small part, but something > nothing.
Chloe and Qing Ning are doing the powerpoint slides/reports. I'd better finish before they start work.

HTTPS is now fully working!!
I've also managed to get PIXI to work, at least, just the 'display a static image' part.
I was actually trying to get it to disappear and reappear on click but I didn't manage that part.
It's 11.47pm already too, so I gotta go sleep now.
The first presentation is tomorrow, and I've not prepared at all. Ah well.
