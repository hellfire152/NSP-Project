First entry of the update log!

I've actually been working on the project for about a week now.
I've managed to get the website up and running, accessible from over the internet.
The security cert still gives me warning with some AltName or something.
I'll solve that by tomorrow.

All the dependencies and stuff has already been decided.
We're using node with socket.io. I decided on this after looking at C# code for the
server, and NOT UNDERSTANDING A SINGLE THING. I could slowly learn it, but frankly
ain't nobody got time for that shit. Javascript's nice in it's own way anyway.
For the client side, we're using Pixi.js for the graphics. Right now it seems like
I have to make all the art/graphics by myself, since my other group members won't do art.
I'll do pixel art so it doesn't overwhelm me. Last thing I want is to deal with 3D models.
For sound I'll use howler.js. The sound is lower priority, but I hope I'll have enough time to do that.

As for progress I'm now only laying all the groundwork for the whole project,
including the API that I (and everyone else) will be using. Frankly that's the most difficult part,
but that means once I manage to finish that, that layer of abstraction will make things much
easier in the long run.

Nigel's handling all database nonsense, so I got that going for me.
Bryan's already done the login thing, it's a small part, but something > nothing.
Chloe and Qing Ning are doing the powerpoint slides/reports. I'd better finish before they start work.

HTTPS is now fully working!!
I've also managed to get PIXI to work, at least, just the 'display a static image' part.
I was actually trying to get it to disappear and reappear on click but I didn't manage that part.
It's 11.47pm already too, so I gotta go sleep now.
The first presentation is tomorrow, and I've not prepared at all. Ah well.

I've moved around a bunch of things, and renamed others.
The main thing I've done is setup, and thinking up the file setup for every future update.
Routing has been set up properly, routes to / will go to index, /play to the play handler, and all else to their specified folders.
That took me a while to figure out, ended up being just me sucking at regex.
Speaking of index, I've moved all (and future) html files to /site, for additional organization.
All initialization of the express app, session handler, and io has been moved to /server/server-setup.js
Node's actually really useful for the modularization.
Figured out form submission using express as well, and in the process had to learn about GET and POST protocols,
and how express handles all that nonsense.
Express is actually really good in abstracting all that process, the XMLHttpSomething stuff and jQuery ajax stuff just confuses
me more than anything else.
Doing the form submission thing also means that the validation and sanitization stuff has the beginning stuff figured out already.
That'll make Qing Ning's job easier later.

Next up, I'm going to do up room joining! (By thursday I hope)
If I'm doing that I'll need to figure out the form data processing too......

The Great Refactoring begins!
I heard the 3 part system the teacher described during one of our practicals
And as such, I'm changing things up to accommodate for that!
Basically, there's the Web Server, Logic Server, and the Database server.
As far as I'm concerned, that means that I have to separate the web server
and the game logic, and have some way to connect the two together.
Most likely socket.io again though.
That also complicates my job by quite a bit.
sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............

Finished the Great Refactoring!
Actually, I did that 2 days ago.
Whatever!
The WebServer and AppServer as I'm going to call them both from now on,
are completely separate! The WebServer and AppServer will authenticate using
a password set using the run-server.bat file too, so that's an extra security feature!
Still, I had to learn batch scripting, which is yet another thing I can do now I guess.
The main thing I managed to do these past 4 days was get those two servers
working together, which was A LOT MORE PAINFUL THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
The hardest part isn't actually coding up what I need now, it's
making sure that I can always extend from all the infrastructure I'm building
up throughout all this time. Javascript's extra loose typing does help in that regard,
but I can't rely on that too much else it becomes too confusing.
For now I put a bunch of switch cases, I hope that's enough to carry the whole project.
Those switches will check for a number or a string as an option, so that's infinitely
extensible, which is just fine and dandy.

I've also finished figuring out another thing: Cookies!
The express-session thing and its documentation gave me so much confusion.
Express-session says I don't need to use cookie-parser, but I couldn't figure out
how to read the cookie without cookie-parser.
I've set their keys to be the same, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Both of these things culminated in me successfully processing the inputs of a form,
then redirecting the user to a page with just one <h1>Hello!</h1> in it.
It's really not much at all, but I'm taking any victory I'm gonna get.

Now that that's all working, next week, I can finally focus on coding the
classic game mode!
